## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I select scenes AND frames at the same time?**  
A: No, you can only select one type at a time (all scenes, or all frames, or all scripts). This keeps modifications focused.

**Q: What if I don't like the AI's changes?**  
A: Just make another selection and request different changes, or use Cmd+Z (undo is auto-saved in version history).

**Q: How specific should my modification request be?**  
A: Be as specific or general as you want:
- Specific: "Make scene 2 exactly 4.5 seconds long"
- General: "Make it more fun and energetic"

Both work! The AI interprets your intent.

**Q: Can I modify the timeline itself?**  
A: Yes! Click scenes in the timeline to select them, then request modifications.

**Q: Will modifications regenerate frames automatically?**  
A: Not automatically. After modifying frame prompts, you can regenerate specific frames by selecting them again and requesting regeneration, or proceed to full video generation.
